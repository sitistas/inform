[Rulebooks::] Rulebooks.

Rulebooks collate rules and provide an organised way for them to collaborate
on a larger task.

@h Introduction.
We think of a rulebook as being a list of rules, for which see the code in
//Booking Lists//, but it also has a good deal of metadata. Handling that
metadata, and managing the creation of rulebooks, are the tasks here.

The semantics of rulebooks grew from their original mid-00s design of being
simple action-focused sets of game rules (for interactive fiction) to a point
in 2009 where they could essentially perform anything which a function in a
functional programming language such as Haskell could do. Their original
game-based purpose nevertheless still shows through in places, as with the
quaint idea of having enumerated ways in which they finish (see //outcomes//).

=
typedef struct rulebook {
	struct wording primary_name; /* name in source text */
	struct wording alternative_name; /* alternative form of name */
	int action_stem_length; /* to do with parsing, but 0 for most rulebooks */

	struct booking_list *contents; /* the actual rules in the rulebook */

	struct focus my_focus; /* what does the rulebook work on? */
	struct outcomes my_outcomes; /* how can it end? */

	int rules_always_test_actor; /* for action-tied check, carry out, report */
	int automatically_generated; /* rather than by explicit Inform 7 source text */
	int runs_during_activities; /* allow "while..." clauses to name these */

	struct shared_variable_set *my_variables; /* rulebook variables owned here */
	struct shared_variable_access_list *accessible_variables; /* and which can be named here */

	struct rulebook_compilation_data compilation_data;
	CLASS_DEFINITION
} rulebook;

@ The following creates one:

=
rulebook *Rulebooks::new(kind *create_as, wording W, package_request *R) {
	rulebook *B = CREATE(rulebook);

	<new-rulebook-name>(W);
	B->primary_name = GET_RW(<new-rulebook-name>, 1);
	B->alternative_name = EMPTY_WORDING;

			"this is a rulebook for values of a kind which isn't definite",
			"and doesn't tell me enough about what sort of value the rulebook should "

@ Focus and outcome are roughly the $X$ and $Y$ if we think of a rulebook as
being analogous to a function $X\to Y$.

	return FocusAndOutcome::get_outcome_kind(&(B->my_outcomes));
}

outcomes *Rulebooks::get_outcomes(rulebook *B) {
	return &(B->my_outcomes);
}

@ During the period when a phrase from a rule in a rulebook is being compiled,
this rather clumsily finds out its return kind. Ideally we would get rid of
the need for this.

=
kind *Rulebooks::kind_from_context(void) {
	id_body *idb = Functions::defn_being_compiled();
	rulebook *B;
	if (idb)
		LOOP_OVER(B, rulebook)
			if (BookingLists::contains_ph(B->contents, idb))
				return Rulebooks::get_outcome_kind(B);
	return NULL;
}

@ While focus and outcome are each more involved than just being a kind of
value, we reduce them to that when working out the kind of a rulebook and
of the rules in it:

=
kind *Rulebooks::to_kind(rulebook *B) {
	return Kinds::binary_con(CON_rulebook,
		Rulebooks::get_focus_kind(B), Rulebooks::get_outcome_kind(B));
}

kind *Rulebooks::contains_kind(rulebook *B) {
	return Kinds::binary_con(CON_rule,
		Rulebooks::get_focus_kind(B), Rulebooks::get_outcome_kind(B));
}

@ Unsurprisingly, the (primary) name for a rulebook becomes a noun which can be
referred to in Inform 7 source text. In fact two alternative forms of this noun
are also created, which are both synonyms for it. Thus if a "coordination"
rulebook is created, it can be referred to as any of "coordination", "coordination rules"
or "coordination rulebook":

=
<rulebook-name-construction> ::=
	... rules |
	... rulebook

@<Make proper nouns so that the rulebook can be a constant value@> =
	Nouns::new_proper_noun(B->primary_name, NEUTER_GENDER, ADD_TO_LEXICON_NTOPT,
		RULEBOOK_MC, Rvalues::from_rulebook(B), Task::language_of_syntax());
	word_assemblage wa =
		PreformUtilities::merge(<rulebook-name-construction>, 0,
			WordAssemblages::from_wording(B->primary_name));
	wording AW = WordAssemblages::to_wording(&wa);
	Nouns::new_proper_noun(AW, NEUTER_GENDER, ADD_TO_LEXICON_NTOPT,
		RULEBOOK_MC, Rvalues::from_rulebook(B), Task::language_of_syntax());
	wa = PreformUtilities::merge(<rulebook-name-construction>, 1,
			WordAssemblages::from_wording(B->primary_name));
	AW = WordAssemblages::to_wording(&wa);
	Nouns::new_proper_noun(AW, NEUTER_GENDER, ADD_TO_LEXICON_NTOPT,
		RULEBOOK_MC, Rvalues::from_rulebook(B), Task::language_of_syntax());

@ It can also subsequently be given a further or "alternative" name, and that
too becomes a proper noun, but is not run through <rulebook-name-construction>
to make still further variants. So the rulebook has at most four different
names, one more than cats have.

=
void Rulebooks::set_alt_name(rulebook *B, wording AW) {
	B->alternative_name = AW;
	Nouns::new_proper_noun(AW, NEUTER_GENDER, ADD_TO_LEXICON_NTOPT,
		RULEBOOK_MC, Rvalues::from_rulebook(B), Task::language_of_syntax());
}

@ And these up to four nouns can be matched with the following nonterminal.

The process of noticing rulebook names inside parts of rule names is much
more complex -- see //Rulebooks::rb_match_from_description// below.

=
<rulebook-name> internal {
	W = Articles::remove_the(W);
	parse_node *p = Lexicon::retrieve(RULEBOOK_MC, W);
	if (Rvalues::is_CONSTANT_construction(p, CON_rulebook)) {
		==> { -, Rvalues::to_rulebook(p) };
		return TRUE;
	}
	==> { fail nonterminal };
}

@ "Automatic" rulebooks sound fancy, but there's very little going on here.
These are created as a knock-on effect of something else being created: for
example if the source text creates an action, then rulebooks for processing
that action are automatically created, and similarly for activities and scenes.

=
rulebook *Rulebooks::new_automatic(wording W, kind *basis,
	int default_outcome, int always_test_actor, int for_activities,
	int stem_length, package_request *R) {
	rulebook *B = Rulebooks::new(Kinds::binary_con(CON_rulebook, basis, K_void), W, R);
	FocusAndOutcome::set_default_outcome(&(B->my_outcomes), default_outcome);
	B->rules_always_test_actor = always_test_actor;
	B->automatically_generated = TRUE;
	B->runs_during_activities = for_activities;
	B->action_stem_length = stem_length;
	return B;
}

@ The author can demand with a "translates as" sentence that a given
rulebook should have an identifier given to it which is accessible to Inter:

=
void Rulebooks::translates(wording W, parse_node *p2) {
	if (<rulebook-name>(W)) {
		rulebook *B = (rulebook *) <<rp>>;
		RTRulebooks::translate(B, Node::get_text(p2));
	} else {
		LOG("Tried %W\n", W);
		StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(),
			_p_(PM_TranslatesNonRulebook),
			"this is not the name of a rulebook",
			"so cannot be translated.");
	}
}

@h Access.

	if (B == RB_check) return TRUE;
	if (B == RB_carry_out) return TRUE;
	if (B == RB_report) return TRUE;

}

int Rulebooks::runs_during_activities(rulebook *B) {
	return B->runs_during_activities;
}

@ |rules_always_test_actor| is set (and meaningful) only for action focuses.
It marks a rulebook as definitely needing to check the actor.

=

	if (Rulebooks::action_focus(B)) {
		if (B->rules_always_test_actor) {

@h Logging.
Just to name it, or giving an inventory of the contents.

@h Attaching and detaching rules.
The following routine contains a bit of a surprise: that the act of
placing a BR within a given rulebook can change it, by altering the way
it acts on its applicability test. This is a device needed to manage
the parallel rulebooks for action processing for the main player character
and for third parties. Though the code below does not make this apparent,
the changes propagate down through the BR to the phrase structure itself.
This is necessary because they manifest themselves in the compiled code
of the phrase, but it is also unfortunate, because it is possible that
the same phrase is used by more than one BR. If it should happen that
BRs are created to place the same phrase into two different rulebooks,
therefore, and which have different actor-testing settings, the outcome
would be confusing. (As unlikely as this seems, it did once happen to a
user in beta-testing.)

=
void Rulebooks::attach_rule(rulebook *B, booking *br,
	int placing, int side, rule *ref_rule) {
	LOGIF(RULE_ATTACHMENTS, "Attaching booking $b to rulebook $K", br, B);

	rule *R = RuleBookings::get_rule(br);

	if ((R == ref_rule) && (side != INSTEAD_SIDE)) {
		StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(),
			_p_(PM_BeforeOrAfterSelf),
			"a rule can't be before or after itself",
			"so this makes no sense to me.");

		inform_extension *BX = Extensions::containing(B->compilation_data.where_declared);
		inform_extension *RX = Extensions::containing(R->compilation_data.where_declared);
		if (BX != RX) {
			StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(),
				_p_(PM_VeryRuleTooDistant),
				"the 'very first' or 'very last' rule for a rulebook can only be "
				"created in the same extension as the rulebook itself",
				"or else in the main body of the source text if that's where the "
				"rulebook is defined.");
			return;
		}
	}

	PluginCalls::rule_placement_notify(R, B, side, ref_rule);

	Rules::put_variables_in_scope(R, Rulebooks::accessible_variables(B));

@h Rule stems.
The voracious nonterminal <rulebook-stem> finds the "stem" of a rule, that is,
the part which identifies which rulebook it will go into. For example, in;

>> Before printing the name of the peach: ...
>> Instead of eating: ...

the stems are "before printing the name" and "instead".

The results are, however, too complicated to return from <rulebook-stem>; since
it is not used recursively, we store the results in |parsed_rm| on success.

@ Suppose this is our rule:

the following grammar peels away the easier-to-read indications at the front. It
notes the use of "The", and the placement "first"; it throws away other verbiage so
that <rulebook-stem-name> matches "printing the name of something".

rulebooks. This is all a bit inelegant, but we manage.

@ |action_stem_length| is zero except for rulebooks derived from actions, such
as "check taking". It is by definition the difference in length between the
rulebook name and the action name -- here, therefore, it's 2 - 1 = 1.

If the entire text |W| is the rulebook name -- in this case, "check taking" --
we match that as normal. But if there is more text -- say, "check taking an
open container" -- then we retreat slightly and match only the prefix "check".
This ensures that something like "check taking or dropping something" is
initially, at least, put into the general check rulebook and not the specific
one for taking, where the "or dropping" part would never have effect.

@<If the matched rulebook was derived from an action, match less text@> =
	if (rm->matched_rulebook->action_stem_length > 0) {
		int w1a = Wordings::first_wn(W) + rm->match_length - 1;
		if (w1a != Wordings::last_wn(W))
			rm->match_length = rm->matched_rulebook->action_stem_length;

@h Notable rulebooks.
A few rulebooks are special to Inform: we recognise them by their English names,
as used when they are created by the Standard Rules extension.
