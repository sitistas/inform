# This change of the relation's nature is impossible in play

When a relation is created during play, it is usually created with a specific nature - for example, `let R be a one-to-one relation of vehicles`. If none is given, it will be `various-to-various`. This can't usually be changed once set, so this problem probably means you've tried to set the nature of the same relation more than once.
