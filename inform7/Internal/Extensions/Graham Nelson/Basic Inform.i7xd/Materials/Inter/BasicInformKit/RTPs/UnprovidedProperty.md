# Unprovided property

Not everything has every property. For instance, a `room` cannot have the property `carrying capacity`: it would not mean anything. Generally speaking, the properties available to something are specified by its kind. If we say that `A room has a number called maximum population.` then the property `maximum population` is available to any room. This applies to either/or properties as well: you might say that a room is not `transparent`, but Inform takes the firm line that we cannot even ask, because it is meaningless for a room to be either `transparent` or `opaque`.

So, anyway, here it seems that you have tried to access a property for something not allowed to have it.
