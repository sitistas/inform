# Low level error

This indicates that some low-level error has occurred in the "veneer", a body of very low-level Inform 6 code used to provide run-time support for Inform 7 story files. Errors like this really shouldn't happen, but might occur if you are doing something very unusual, or if there is a bug in Inform. If you don't seem to be doing anything you shouldn't, please report this to the authors of Inform as a possible bug.
