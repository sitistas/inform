# Can't decide on nothing

When we write a phrase `To decide which K is ...`, where K is a kind such as `door` or `room`, say, any use of `decide on X` inside the definition of that phrase must result in X being the appropriate kind of thing. Here, X turned out to be `nothing`, which is not an object at all. While this can be used for something of kind `object`, it otherwise can't be used.
