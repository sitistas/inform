# Attempt to look up a non-existent row in table

This is a straightforward problem: you tried to look up a row which didn't exist. For instance, if there are three rows, then an attempt to look up an entry on row 4 will produce this problem. (What may be a little less straightforward is that the problem doesn't show itself when you choose a row, only when you make use of it.)
