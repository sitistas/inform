# File being read is not a previously saved table

The contents of tables can be saved into disc files and subsequently loaded in again, perhaps on a different run, or even into the same table but in a different project. Here, I tried to load in such a file, but it turned out not to be that sort of file at all - it had not previously been saved from a table.
