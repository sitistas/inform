# Tried to change a relation for objects with the wrong kinds

For example, if you defined `Application relates various devices to one thing. The verb to be applied to implies the application relation.`, and then wrote `now Peter is applied to the spoon`, you might see this problem because Peter is a man and not a device. If you wrote `now the sonic screwdriver is applied to the Dalek Base`, you might see this because the Dalek Base is a room and not a thing.
