# You can't take the square root of a negative number

Inform's `square root of...` phrase can only take the square root of 0 or a positive number. Although mathematicians are able to invent imaginary numbers, making sense out of square roots of negative numbers, Inform doesn't do this. There just isn't an Inform `number` which squares to give -1, so it cannot possibly produce a result of `the square root of -1`.
