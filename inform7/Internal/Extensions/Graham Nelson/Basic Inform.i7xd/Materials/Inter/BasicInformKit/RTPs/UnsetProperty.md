# Never-set property

It sometimes happens that - although something could in principle have a given property - in fact it doesn't. That makes it impossible to use.

For instance, although every `thing` is allowed to have a `description` property, it will only be given one if the source text says so explicitly. That makes writing `the description of the noun` (say) a little chancy, because it assumes the noun will be a thing which has a description - which might not always be true. If you would like to make sure everything does have a description property, you can always write a sentence like `The description of a thing is usually "Dull.".`
