# You can't implicitly repeat through the values of this kind

With some kinds of value, like scenes, you can easily repeat through all possibilities at run-time: there are only a small number of them, and their values are easy to work out and put into a sensible order. With others, either there are too many (this is why repeating through numbers or texts can't be done) or they have no sensible order (this is why repeating through rules can't be done). You can see which kinds can be repeated through on the Kinds index page.

Inform tries to catch this mistake when translating the source text if possible, but sometimes it isn't possible, and this problem message is the result.
