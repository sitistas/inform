# Attempt to say a snippet value which is currently invalid

A snippet is a fragment of the player's current command, but it does not record the actual text: instead, it notes only the word numbers. (Thus in TAKE ME TO THE RIVER, a snippet would be words 2 to 4 rather than the text "ME TO THE".) Snippets go out of date as soon as a new command has come along, so shouldn't be kept in longer-term storage. At any rate, the one you've just tried to say goes outside the range of the current command, so it can't be right.
