# Only backdrops can be moved to regions

Regions combine a number of rooms under a single name. That means that to be moved to a region would mean being inside all of those rooms simultaneously, and only objects of the kind `backdrop` are allowed to be multiply-present like this. (If you already knew this, then the problem is probably that you forgot to make it a backdrop.)
