# The scene hasn't ended, so you can't ask when it did

Suppose there is a scene called `Second Stage`. Asking for `the time when Second Stage ended` or `the time since Second Stage ended` only makes sense if Second Stage has taken place. It's easy to test for this: for instance, `if Second Stage has ended and the time since Second Stage ended is more than five minutes...`
