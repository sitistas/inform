# Doors cannot be moved in play

The ability to change map connections during play is quite constrained, and although the `change ... exit of ... to ...` phrase exists, it should only be used as a last resort. (Better to apply rules which cause the map not to be followed than to actually alter the map, is the idea.) In particular, doors must not be disturbed at all, and here you tried to change an exit which led through a door: this is not allowed.
