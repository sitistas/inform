# Unable to change map connection

The ability to change map connections during play is quite constrained, and although the `change ... exit of ... to ...` phrase exists, it should only be used as a last resort. (Better to apply rules which cause the map not to be followed than to actually alter the map, is the idea.) In principle any exit which does not lead to a door can be changed, but here there seems not to have been exit to change.
