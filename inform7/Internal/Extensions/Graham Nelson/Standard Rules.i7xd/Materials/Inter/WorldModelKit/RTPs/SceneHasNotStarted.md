# The scene hasn't started, so you can't ask when it did

Suppose there is a scene called `Second Stage`. Asking for `the time when Second Stage began` or `the time since Second Stage began` only makes sense if Second Stage has happened (or is happening now). This problem turns up if you ask such questions about a scene which hasn't happened. It's easy to test for this: for instance, `if Second Stage has happened and the time since Second Stage began is more than five minutes...`
