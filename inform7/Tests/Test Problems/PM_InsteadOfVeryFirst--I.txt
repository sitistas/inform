  >--> You wrote 'The bogus rule is listed instead of the exalted rule in the
    grandiose rules' (source text, line 20): but 'very first' or 'very last'
    rules cannot be replaced with 'instead', since this allows the creator of
    the rulebook to be certain that they will always be in place.
Inform 7 has finished.
