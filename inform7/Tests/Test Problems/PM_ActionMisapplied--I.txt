  >--> You wrote 'Decreeing is an action applying to one icon' (source text, line 3):
    but an action cannot apply to specific kinds of object such as 'room' or
    'vehicle', and if it is going to apply to objects at all then it should
    talk about them as 'things'. For example, 'Driving is an action applying to
    one touchable thing' might be the way to set up an action for driving, even
    if it makes sense only for a 'vehicle'. A rule like 'Check driving: if the
    noun is not a vehicle, ...' would then be a good idea.
Inform 7 has finished.
