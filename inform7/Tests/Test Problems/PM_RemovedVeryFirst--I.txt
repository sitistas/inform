  >--> You wrote 'The exalted rule is not listed in the grandiose rules' (source
    text, line 14): but 'very first' or 'very last' rules cannot be removed by
    'not listed in', since this allows the creator of the rulebook to be
    certain that they will always be in place.
Inform 7 has finished.
