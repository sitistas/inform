Problem__ PM_NonInstanceVerbForm
  >--> 'verb are suspicious of' can't be used as a value of the kind 'verb'. In
    general, forms such as 'to be' plus a preposition, or auxiliary verbs, are
    not allowed in this context, because they aren't really different verbs in
    the way that, say, 'the verb carry' or 'the verb enclose' are.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
     meaning of (verb are suspicious of - verb) 
    But I didn't recognise 'verb are suspicious of'.
Inform 7 has finished.
