Problem__ PM_BareObjectProperty
  >--> You wrote 'The rock has an object' (source text, line 5): but this would
    create a property whose name is also the name of a kind of object, and
    although bare names of kinds are usually allowed as properties, those can't
    be names of kinds of object - that becomes too confusing when sentences
    involving 'to have' come up. (Suppose we allowed 'A person has a thing.' to
    create a new property, with no name, identified only by being a thing. What
    would a sentence like 'Dr Jones has a ray gun.' mean, then? Would it mean
    Jones has an actual ray gun, or only that his 'thing' property has the
    value 'ray gun'? That's too ambiguous. Instead 'A person has a thing called
    talisman. Professor Smith has the ray gun. The talisman of Dr Jones is the
    ray gun.' is much clearer.)
Problem__ PM_BareObjectProperty
  >--> You wrote 'The rock has a thing' (source text, line 6): again, this
    would create a property whose name is also the name of a kind of object.
