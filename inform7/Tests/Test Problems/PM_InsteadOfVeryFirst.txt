Problem: PM_InsteadOfVeryFirst

Burrow is a room.

The grandiose rules are a rulebook.

First grandiose rule:
	say "I am a first grandiose rule."

First grandiose rule:
	say "I am also a first grandiose rule."

Very first grandiose rule (this is the exalted rule):
	say "I am the very first grandiose rule."

Very last grandiose rule:
	say "I am the very last grandiose rule."

This is the bogus rule:
	say "I am bogus."

The bogus rule is listed instead of the exalted rule in the grandiose rules.
