I've now read your source text, which is 28 words long.
I've also read version 2 of Basic Inform by Graham Nelson, which is 10686 words long.
I've also read version 10.2.0 of English Language by Graham Nelson, which is 2330 words long.
I've also read version 10.2.0 of Standard Rules by Graham Nelson, which is 35530 words long.
Problem__ PM_HeadingInPlaceOfUnknown
  >--> In the sentence 'Section of Minimal Grammar (in place of Section SR4/10
    - Mythical Stuff in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3),
    it looks as if you intend to replace a section of source text from the
    extension 'Standard Rules by Graham Nelson', but that extension does not
    seem to have any heading called 'Section SR4/10 - Mythical Stuff'. (The
    version I loaded was 10.2.0.)
Inform 7 has finished.
