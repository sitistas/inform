Problem__ PM_CannotPlaceVeryFirst
  >--> In 'The Wombling rule is listed very first in the Before rulebook' (source
    text, line 5), you asked to change or impose a 'very first' or 'very last'
    rule for a rulebook. But those rules are restricted and can be written only
    alongside the rulebook itself, and cannot afterwards be changed with
    sentences like this one.
Inform 7 has finished.
