  L is initially {}.
  L is now {11}.
  L is now {11, 7, 200, 5, -6, 0}.
  Adding 5 if absent should make no difference: {11, 7, 200, 5, -6, 0}.
  Entry 2 of L is 7.
  After changing entry 3 to 104, L is now {11, 7, 104, 5, -6, 0}.
  After changing entry 3 to 208, L is now {11, 7, 208, 5, -6, 0}.
  After changing the two end entries, L is now {1, 7, 208, 5, -6, 6}.
  These, however, should fail as being out of range.

  *** Attempt to use list item which does not exist.

  L now contains two instances of 208: {1, 7, 208, 5, -6, 6, 208}.
  Both of which go after removing this value: {1, 7, 5, -6, 6}.
  Adding {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} to L gives {1, 7, 5, -6, 6, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}.
  Removing the same set then gives {1, -6, 6}.
  Adding {7, 11, 5, 16} to M, if absent, gives {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 16}.
  Adding 1001 at entry 3 gives {2, 3, 1001, 5, 7, 11, 16}.
  Removing entry 2 gives {2, 1001, 5, 7, 11, 16}.
  Removing entries 2 to 4 gives {2, 11, 16}.
