  Cabin
  The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.
  
  Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.
  
  The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally checking the radar readout.

  Cabin
  The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, one of which is currently lifted to allow access to the storage compartment within. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.
  
  Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.
  
  The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally checking the radar readout.
  
  >[30] give coke to captain
  "Ah, thank you," he says. How he can drink an iced soda on a day like today is an open question, but Alaskans are special.
  
  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]
  
  >[31] ask captain for key
  "Here, knock yourself out."
  
  >[32] open case
  (first unlocking the glass case)
  (with the small silver key)
  You open the glass case.
  
  >[33] get rods
  (putting the nets into the backpack to make room)
  Success is yours! (Now if only you knew anything about fishing.)
  
  
  
      *** The End ***
