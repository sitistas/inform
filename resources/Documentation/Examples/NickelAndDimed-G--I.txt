Subway Station
A turnstile is all that separates you from the subway platform stairs.

A newspaper man in a knit cap and fingerless gloves is hopping up and down behind his stand. Cold weather, caffeine overdose, or mental illness? You may never know. Welcome to New York.

On the stand are a copy of the New York Times ($1.25), a pack of gum ($0.40), a paperback novel ($7.99) and a packet of trading cards ($0.99).

You can also see a ticket machine here.

You can see a dollar bill here.
